Q 1) there details you provided for the Students, Teachers, and Grades tables:

Table Structure
Students:

id (student's ID)
name (student's name)
teacher_id (ID of the teacher who teaches the student)
Teachers:

id (teacher's ID)
name (teacher's name)
Grades:

Student_id (ID of the student)
Assignment_id (ID of the assignment)
Grades (grade obtained by the student)

-- 1. Create the Students table
CREATE TABLE Students (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    teacher_id INT
);

-- 2. Create the Teachers table
CREATE TABLE Teachers (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

-- 3. Create the Grades table
CREATE TABLE Grades (
    Student_id INT,
    Assignment_id INT,
    Grades DECIMAL(5, 2),
    PRIMARY KEY (Student_id, Assignment_id)
);

-- Insert data into Teachers table
INSERT INTO Teachers (id, name)
VALUES 
    (1, 'Mr. Smith'),
    (2, 'Ms. Johnson'),
    (3, 'Dr. Brown');

-- Insert data into Students table
INSERT INTO Students (id, name, teacher_id)
VALUES
    (101, 'Alice', 1),
    (102, 'Bob', 2),
    (103, 'Charlie', 3),
    (104, 'David', 1),
    (105, 'Eve', 2);

-- Insert data into Grades table
INSERT INTO Grades (Student_id, Assignment_id, Grades)
VALUES
    (101, 1, 85.5),
    (101, 2, 92.0),
    (102, 1, 78.0),
    (102, 2, 81.5),
    (103, 1, 88.0),
    (103, 2, 90.0),
    (104, 1, 75.0),
    (104, 2, 70.5),
    (105, 1, 95.0),
    (105, 2, 89.5);

Print student_id, student_name, and teacher_name: You need to join the Students table with the Teachers table using the teacher_id field from the Students table and the id field from the Teachers table.


SELECT 
    s.id AS student_id, 
    s.name AS student_name, 
    t.name AS teacher_name
FROM 
    Students s
JOIN 
    Teachers t 
ON 
    s.teacher_id = t.id;


Explanation:
Students s and Teachers t are table aliases for ease of reference.
This query joins the Students and Teachers tables on the teacher's ID.
It selects the student's ID, student’s name, and teacher’s name.
Print student_id and the average grade where grades are more than half of the average:

First, we need to calculate the average grade for all students and then filter out grades that are more than half of this average.


SELECT 
    g.Student_id,
    AVG(g.Grades) AS avg_grade
FROM 
    Grades g
GROUP BY 
    g.Student_id
HAVING 
    AVG(g.Grades) > (SELECT AVG(Grades) / 2 FROM Grades);


Explanation:
AVG(g.Grades) calculates the average grade for each student (grouped by Student_id).
The HAVING clause ensures that only students whose average grade is more than half of the overall average grade are returned.
(SELECT AVG(Grades) / 2 FROM Grades) calculates half of the overall average grade across all students.
Summary
The first query joins the Students and Teachers tables and prints the required details.
The second query filters students who have an average grade greater than half the overall average and prints their student_id and average grade.

Q 2) To create the necessary tables in SQL for both scenarios (Candidates and Donations, and Employee and Sales), here is the structure for each:

Scenario 1: Candidate, Donation, and Charity Tables
sql
Copy code
-- Create the Candidate table
CREATE TABLE Candidate (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Create the Charity table
CREATE TABLE Charity (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Create the Donation table
CREATE TABLE Donation (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    candidate_id INT,
    charity_id INT,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (candidate_id) REFERENCES Candidate(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (charity_id) REFERENCES Charity(id)
);

-- Insert sample data into Candidate table
INSERT INTO Candidate (id, name) VALUES
(1, 'John Doe'),
(2, 'Jane Smith'),
(3, 'Alice Brown');

-- Insert sample data into Charity table
INSERT INTO Charity (id, name) VALUES
(1, 'Red Cross'),
(2, 'Habitat for Humanity');

-- Insert sample data into Donation table
INSERT INTO Donation (id, candidate_id, charity_id, amount) VALUES
(1, 1, 1, 25.00),
(2, 1, 2, 30.00),
(3, 2, 1, 45.00),
(4, 3, 2, 50.00),
(5, 3, 1, 15.00);


Scenario 2: Employee and Sales Tables

sql
Copy code
-- Create the Employee table
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Create the Sales table
CREATE TABLE Sales (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_id INT,
    sale_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES Employee(id)
);

-- Insert sample data into Employee table
INSERT INTO Employee (id, name) VALUES
(1, 'Alice'),
(2, 'Bob'),
(3, 'Charlie');

-- Insert sample data into Sales table
INSERT INTO Sales (id, employee_id, sale_amount) VALUES
(1, 1, 200.00),
(2, 1, 150.00),
(3, 2, 300.00),
(4, 3, 100.00),
(5, 1, 250.00),
(6, 2, 100.00);


/////////////////////////////answer/////////////////////////////////////////

Query 1: Find aggregate donations that are <= 50
sql
Copy code
SELECT c.name AS candidate_name, SUM(d.amount) AS total_donation
FROM Donation d
JOIN Candidate c ON d.candidate_id = c.id
GROUP BY c.name
HAVING SUM(d.amount) <= 50;


Scenario 2: Employee and Sales Tables
We are tasked with finding the maximum number of sales done by an employee.

Assuming we have the following table structures:

Employee: id, name
Sales: id, employee_id, sale_amount
Query 2: Find the employee with the highest number of sales
sql
Copy code
SELECT e.name AS employee_name, COUNT(s.id) AS total_sales
FROM Sales s
JOIN Employee e ON s.employee_id = e.id
GROUP BY e.name
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 1;
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Q 3) Create Fresh SalesPerson and Sales Tables
Now, create the tables with the correct structure:


-- Create SalesPerson table
CREATE TABLE SalesPerson (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,     -- Unique identifier for each salesperson
    name TEXT                   -- Name of the salesperson
);

-- Create Sales table with a foreign key to SalesPerson
CREATE TABLE Sales (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,           -- Unique identifier for each sale
    salesperson_id INTEGER,           -- Foreign key linking to SalesPerson table
    sale_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),       -- Amount of the sale
    sale_date DATE,                   -- Date of the sale
    FOREIGN KEY (salesperson_id) REFERENCES SalesPerson(id) -- Foreign key constraint
);
Step 3: Insert Sample Data
Now, insert the data into both tables:

sql
Copy code
-- Insert sample data into SalesPerson table
INSERT INTO SalesPerson (id, name) VALUES
(1, 'Alice'),
(2, 'Bob'),
(3, 'Charlie');

-- Insert sample data into Sales table (with salesperson_id)
INSERT INTO Sales (id, salesperson_id, sale_amount, sale_date) VALUES
(1, 1, 5000.00, '2023-07-01'),  -- Alice's sale in July
(2, 1, 7000.00, '2023-08-01'),  -- Alice's sale in August
(3, 2, 9000.00, '2023-08-01'),  -- Bob's sale in August
(4, 3, 3000.00, '2023-09-01'),  -- Charlie's sale in September
(5, 2, 15000.00, '2023-07-01'); -- Bob's sale in July
Step 4: Run the Query to Find the Salesperson with the Highest Sales
Finally, execute the query to find the highest sales for any salesperson in a single month:

sql
Copy code
-- Query to find the salesperson with the highest sales in any single month
-- Query to find the salesperson with the highest sales in any single month
SELECT sp.name AS salesperson_name,
       strftime('%Y', s.sale_date) AS sale_year,        -- Extract year
       strftime('%m', s.sale_date) AS sale_month,       -- Extract month
       SUM(s.sale_amount) AS total_sales
FROM Sales s
JOIN SalesPerson sp ON s.salesperson_id = sp.id
GROUP BY sp.name, sale_year, sale_month
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 1;  -- Get the top record with the highest total sales

Q4)
To derive revenues by region and rank the regions from highest to lowest while also calculating the percentage of total revenue for each region, you can use the following SQL queries:

Query 1: Revenue by Region with Percentage Calculation
This query calculates the total revenue for each region and the percentage of total revenue contributed by each region.

SELECT Region, 
       SUM(Revenue) AS TotalRevenue,
       (SUM(Revenue) / (SELECT SUM(Revenue) FROM Sales)) * 100 AS Percentage
FROM Sales
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC;



Explanation of the First Query:
SUM(Revenue): Calculates the total revenue for each region.
(SUM(Revenue) / (SELECT SUM(Revenue) FROM Sales)) * 100: Calculates the percentage of total revenue for each region.
GROUP BY Region: Groups the results by region.
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC: Orders the results in descending order of total revenue.
Query 2: Ranking Regions Using RANK() Over Partition
This query ranks the regions based on total revenue.

sql
Copy code
SELECT Region, 
       SUM(Revenue) AS TotalRevenue,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(Revenue) DESC) AS RevenueRank
FROM Sales
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY RevenueRank;



Explanation of the Second Query:
SUM(Revenue): Again calculates the total revenue for each region.
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(Revenue) DESC): Assigns a rank to each region based on the total revenue in descending order. Regions with the same total revenue will receive the same rank.
GROUP BY Region: Groups the results by region.
ORDER BY RevenueRank: Orders the final output based on the ranking.
