1. Highest Salary from Each Department

SELECT department, MAX(salary) AS highest_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;

2. Second Highest Salary from a Table
Approach 1: Using DISTINCT and LIMIT/OFFSET (for MySQL, PostgreSQL)

SELECT DISTINCT salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;

Approach 2: Using Subquery

SELECT MAX(salary) AS second_highest_salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);
3. Nth Highest Salary from a Table
Using DISTINCT, ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET

-- Replace :n with the desired rank (e.g., 3 for 3rd highest)
SELECT DISTINCT salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET :n-1;
Using DENSE_RANK() in databases that support window functions:

SELECT salary
FROM (
    SELECT salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
    FROM employees
) ranked
WHERE rank = :n;


4. Find Duplicates in a Table (All 3 Approaches)
Assume we want to find duplicates based on the email column.

Approach 1: Using GROUP BY with HAVING

SELECT email, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM employees
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
Approach 2: Using SELF JOIN


SELECT a.*
FROM employees a
JOIN employees b
  ON a.email = b.email
 AND a.id <> b.id;
Approach 3: Using ROW_NUMBER()

SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY email ORDER BY id) AS rn
    FROM employees
) temp
WHERE rn > 1;

Subqueries
1. Top and Least Performer Employees Using Subqueries
Assume we measure performance by salary:

-- Top Performer
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary = (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);

-- Least Performer
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary = (SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employees);
If performance is measured using another column (e.g., performance_score), replace salary accordingly.

2. Add a Tag Column Based on Salary Ranges

SELECT *,
  CASE 
    WHEN salary < 30000 THEN 'low'
    WHEN salary BETWEEN 30000 AND 50000 THEN 'med'
    WHEN salary > 50000 THEN 'high'
  END AS salary_tag
FROM employees;
3. Employees Who Changed Their Address > 3 Times in Last 3 Months
Assume we have a table address_changes(emp_id, change_date, old_address, new_address):


SELECT emp_id
FROM address_changes
WHERE change_date >= ADD_MONTHS(SYSDATE, -3)
GROUP BY emp_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;
For MySQL:


WHERE change_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 3 MONTH)


Here are some commonly asked advanced SQL questions, along with solutions, focusing on topics like removing duplicates, fetching highest salaries, and other frequently asked concepts in SQL interviews:

Q1. Remove Duplicate Records from a Table
To remove duplicate rows, we typically use a DELETE statement along with ROW_NUMBER(), CTE, or DISTINCT. Here's one way using ROW_NUMBER():


WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT 
        ID, 
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY column_name ORDER BY ID) AS row_num
    FROM 
        your_table
)
DELETE FROM CTE
WHERE row_num > 1;
PARTITION BY column_name ensures that rows with the same value in column_name are treated as duplicates.
Only the first occurrence of each duplicate is retained.


Q2. Find the 1st and 2nd Highest Salaries
You can use LIMIT or ROW_NUMBER() to fetch the highest and second-highest salaries:

a) Find the Highest Salary

SELECT MAX(salary) AS highest_salary
FROM employees;
b) Find the Second Highest Salary

SELECT MAX(salary) AS second_highest_salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);
c) Find the Nth Highest Salary
If you need the Nth highest salary, ROW_NUMBER() or DENSE_RANK() can be helpful:


SELECT salary 
FROM (
    SELECT salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
    FROM employees
) ranked_salaries
WHERE rank = N;  -- Replace N with 2 for second-highest, 3 for third-highest, etc.
3. Get Employees Who Earn More Than the Average Salary

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
4. Find Common Records Between Two Tables (Intersection)
To get records common to two tables, you can use INNER JOIN or INTERSECT:


SELECT column_name
FROM table1
INTERSECT
SELECT column_name
FROM table2;
5. Find Employees Hired in the Last 6 Months

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date >= ADD_MONTHS(SYSDATE, -6);
6. Find Employees with Duplicate Email Addresses

SELECT email, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
7. Count Total Employees in Each Department

SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
8. Get Employee Details Along with their Manager's Details

SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, m.first_name AS manager_first_name, m.last_name AS manager_last_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;
9. Get the Department with the Highest Number of Employees

SELECT department
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 1;
10. Find the Employees Who Have No Manager (NULL Values in Manager ID)

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE manager_id IS NULL;
11. Get Employees Who Joined Between Two Dates

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';
12. Find Employees Whose Name Starts with 'A'

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE 'A%';
13. Find the Maximum Salary for Each Department

SELECT department, MAX(salary) AS highest_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
14. Delete Duplicate Rows (Without Using CTE)
If you don't want to use CTE, here's another way to remove duplicates:


DELETE FROM employees
WHERE rowid NOT IN (
    SELECT MIN(rowid)
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY first_name, last_name, salary
);
15. Find the Total Salary Paid by Department

SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
16. Update Salary of Employees by 10% Where Salary is Less Than 5000

UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary * 1.10
WHERE salary < 5000;
17. Find Employees Who Work in More Than One Department
This question assumes a department_employees table for many-to-many relationships.


SELECT employee_id, COUNT(department_id) AS department_count
FROM department_employees
GROUP BY employee_id
HAVING COUNT(department_id) > 1;
18. Rank Employees by Their Salary
Using RANK() or DENSE_RANK():


SELECT employee_id, salary, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
FROM employees;
19. Get the Department with the Lowest Average Salary

SELECT department
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY AVG(salary)
LIMIT 1;
20. Get the Employee with the Longest Tenure

SELECT employee_id, hire_date
FROM employees
ORDER BY hire_date ASC
LIMIT 1;
21. Count the Number of Employees by Gender

SELECT gender, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY gender;
22. Self Join to Find Employees and their Colleagues in the Same Department

SELECT e1.first_name AS employee, e2.first_name AS colleague
FROM employees e1
JOIN employees e2 ON e1.department = e2.department AND e1.employee_id != e2.employee_id;
23. Get the Last Record in a Table
This assumes you have a timestamp column or auto-increment ID:


SELECT *
FROM employees
ORDER BY hire_date DESC
LIMIT 1;
These are some of the most commonly asked SQL interview questions, with solutions for various scenarios, from basic SQL queries to more complex ones involving ranking, duplicates, and aggregations.
